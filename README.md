## What is Archicad?  

**Archicad** is a professional-grade **BIM application** built for architects and engineers who need precision, scalability, and collaboration in every stage of a project. Created by **Graphisoft**, it merges intelligent modeling, real-time teamwork, and technical documentation into one unified workspace.  

Unlike traditional CAD software, Archicad focuses on **data-driven design** — every model element holds rich building information that can be used for schedules, cost estimation, and energy analysis. This integrated workflow helps professionals move from conceptual sketches to construction documentation with accuracy and efficiency.  

Archicad feels native and fast. It’s optimized for **Apple Silicon**, supporting large 3D models and complex BIM data without lag. When paired with **Enscape**, users can explore live 3D visualizations directly inside the design — enabling instant lighting feedback, realistic textures, and immersive walkthroughs.  

Whether you’re designing a small studio project or a large-scale development, Archicad brings together **precision tools, visual control**, and **multi-user collaboration**, helping architects deliver ideas faster and with full design integrity.
